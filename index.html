      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Aspiring Data Scientist pursuing a Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with hands-on experience in statistical modeling,
        data visualization, and predictive analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus is on extracting the value of simplicity from concepts, models, and visuals, while always aiming to uncover impactful insights from data.
      </p>
      <p>
        My toolkit includes Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, with a strong focus on creating interactive dashboards,
        building performance tracking systems, and generating insights that drive business decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my professional journey at Tata Technologies Ltd., Gurugram, joining as a Graduate Engineer Trainee via campus placement and later promoted to Associate.
        I collaborated with Dassault Systèmes, specializing in CATIA V5 for automotive design.
        I conducted technical training for clients, optimized design workflows, and resolved both software and administrative issues — sharpening my technical depth, problem-solving abilities, and client communication skills.

          <h4>Predicting Flight Delays Using Machine Learning for Operational Efficiency in Aviation</h4>
          <p>
            Beyond operational insights for airlines, proposed an insurance-linked product innovation: delay predictions at booking time can enable passengers to opt for micro-insurance, paying a small premium to receive fare refunds for significant delays.
            This transforms delay forecasting into a monetizable service, enhancing customer experience and creating a potential revenue stream for travel platforms or insurers.
            The machine learning model is used to predict flight delays using over 6.4 million records of 2019 U.S. flight data, enriched with airline schedules, weather conditions, and airport-level features.
            Applied models like Logistic Regression, XGBoost after rigorous EDA and feature engineering.

          <h4>Identifying Product Bundling Opportunities Using Sales Cointegration and Revenue Simulation</h4>
          <p>
            The approach enables bundling decisions, helping businesses boost sales of lagging products, optimize promotion timing, and improve cart value—ultimately driving revenue and customer retention through targeted cross-selling.
            These are achieved by developing a bundling strategy using econometric techniques to identify product category pairs with long-term co-movement (cointegration).
            Applied OLS regression to estimate bundle ratios and used error correction models with z-score signals to detect underperforming categories.
            Simulated 5% revenue uplift and validated results using paired t-tests.

          <h4>Portfolio Optimization Using Pair Trading of Stocks</h4>
          <p>
            The work proposes a cointegration-based pair trading approach for stock portfolio design that can be used to earn profit by the investors in the stock market.
            The innovative trading strategy provides the investors with reliable signals for triggering the short, long, or no action needed for carrying out transactions in the portfolio for one year from during the portfolio test period.
            The pair-trading models are trained and evaluated on real-world stock market data and the results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.

          <h4>Sales Performance Dashboard for Coffee Shop Chain Using Power BI</h4>
          <p>
            Designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze daily sales data (Jan-June 2023) for a multi-location coffee shop chain.
            The dashboard empowers management with data-driven insights on peak sales periods and cold sales hours, high-performing products, and operational bottlenecks allowing them to decide on product bundling, discounts and offers.
            Connected data from PostgreSQL and developed KPIs including total revenue, MoM growth, category-wise sales, and store-level performance.
            Enabled interactive drilldowns by date, hour, and location, and compared weekday vs. weekend behavior.
